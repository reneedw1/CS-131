# CS 131 Final Project: Color Edge Detection for Low Contrast Images 
## Abstract 
Traditional edge detection algorithms don't work very well on low-contrast images. Due to the lack of contrast in low-contrast images, capturing all possible data is crucial. Color edge detection algorithms have never been developed and tested specifically for this issue (low-contrast images). This paper explores three different color space representations. Additionally, it considers two different edge-detection pipelines using Canny edge detection. One such pipeline combines the three channels produced in a color space representation, running Canny edge detection on the combined input. The other performs Canny edge detection on each channel individually, combining the three edge maps into one after edge detection. The results of these methods show that color edge detection works better for all three color spaces than a traditional Canny edge detector on low-contrast images. Additionally, the channel separation pipeline performs substantially better for each color representation than the channel combination pipeline.
